# Project Proposal

## Athena's Music Ranking System

### What and Why?
I'd like to build a music ranking system that would allow users to rate the album and/or songs within an album. This system would provide a fun way to explore the users' music tastes as well as being able to connect with their friends to show them their thoughts on the music. This would allow for users to take part in the ranking and critiquing of music instead of it being solely restricted to music critics and publications. 

### For Whom?
The software would be geared towards the mass consumer and people like me, specifically the teen and early adult demographic. Especially those that find themselves enjoying tier lists, listening to music, and/or have a passion for music. This would allow them to connect more with friends as well about common interests.

### How?
The app will function like Letterboxd or beli; an end-user will search up an album from an artist and be able to give the album a review as well as rate it out of 5 stars. The user will also be able to relog the album if their thoughts change. They will also be able to click on the album and rank the songs on the album according to their tastes i.e. 1 through n. The app will then keep a "diary" log of the albums that have been rated by the user. The user can choose some albums and favorite them. The user can also follow and unfollow other users.

### Scope
This system will rely on accessing a large, constantly updating music database (Spotify API??) and integrating a multi-leveled rating system. The usage of various, complex data structures will provide a difficult challenge to get all the information displaying correctly across various windows. It will also be a challenge to have an instantaneous updating database of users to follow and unfollow. However, this project could prove to be an enriching experience to learn how to work with open databases and create a usable social netowrking software.
